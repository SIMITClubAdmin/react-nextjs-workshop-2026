/**
 * ============================================================================
 * WORKSHOP STATE CONFIGURATION
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This file controls workshop availability. Day 1 is permanently open. Day 2
 * can be opened globally here or for one browser by completing the hidden
 * `/admin` route quest.
 * There is no database.
 *
 * HOW ORGANIZERS SHOULD USE THIS:
 *
 * 1. DAY 1:
 *    Keep `isDay1Unlocked` true. The admin page intentionally has no Day 1
 *    lock control.
 *
 * 2. ON DAY 2 (22 Jul — permanent unlock for everyone):
 *    Change `isDay2Unlocked` to `true`, then redeploy. Every student will
 *    see Day 2.
 *
 * 3. ROUTE QUEST / TESTING (unlock for ONE browser only):
 *    Students discover `/admin`, solve the routing question, and claim the
 *    browser-only key. This writes to localStorage and does not affect others.
 *
 * 4. DAY 2 RECAP:
 *    Auto-unlocks at `DAY2_RECAP_UNLOCK_AT` (23 Jul 2026 00:00 SGT).
 *    Keep `isDay2RecapReady` false until the PDF is in public/slides/, then
 *    flip to true and redeploy. Use `isDay2RecapForceUnlocked` only for testing.
